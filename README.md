# Fifa_World_Cup_Analaysis

To Do - I looked closely at the FIFA18 dataset and made lots of charts and graphs to understand it better. I got the dataset from a GitHub page. My aim was to figure out who should play on the teams from France, Germany, Spain, England, Brazil, Argentina, Belgium, Portugal, Uruguay, and Croatia in the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

# Description

This project is all about diving into FIFA World Cup data, covering the years from 1930 to 2014. We've got information on matches, players, and which teams held the cup during that time span. We've done a bunch of analysis on it, creating cool charts and graphs to help us understand the data better and pick up some insights along the way.


# Project Goal

This project focuses on analyzing FIFA World Cup data to uncover insights about matches, player patterns, cup holders, and other interesting trends. I used data sourced from Kaggle, covering the period from 1930 to 2014. The dataset is divided into three Excel files: one for players, one for matches, and another for cup holders. By diving into this data, I aimed to understand various aspects of the World Cup, including patterns in player performance, home ground advantage, and more.
