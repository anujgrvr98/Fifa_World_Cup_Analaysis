# Fifa_World_Cup_Analaysis

To Do - I looked closely at the FIFA18 dataset and made lots of charts and graphs to understand it better. I got the dataset from a GitHub page. My aim was to figure out who should play on the teams from France, Germany, Spain, England, Brazil, Argentina, Belgium, Portugal, Uruguay, and Croatia in the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
